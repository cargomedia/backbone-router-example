## About

This project shows that navigation with query string in Backbone was impossible to achieve for me. In the end I was able to have a query string in `routes` of Backbone but only with hashtag in URL which is unacceptable IMO. Such projects as `backbone-query-parameters` also enable support with hashtag in URL. That is very sad.
